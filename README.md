# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Let's settle this like adults with a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Description

This app is built with Javascript. It was constructed around the same premise of the kids game. Two players, in this case a user and a computer will both choose either rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s). 

## How to play

As a player enters the game, they will be prompted to respond with how many times they wish to play. 

The player will get to choose between rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s). The screen will then tell the player what the computer chose. The computer's choice is random. After clicking Ok, the user will be awarded a point for the win, lose, or tie. The next round will then begin. Each round is played the same way until the final round is completed.

A "For" loop is used to track each round and store the wins, loses, and ties. The final score is displayed at the end of the game.
