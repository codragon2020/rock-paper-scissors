# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Let's settle this like adults with a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Description

This app is built with Javascript. It was constructed around the same premise of the kids game. Two players, in this case a user and a computer will both choose either rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s). 

## How to play

As a player enters the game, they will be prompted to respond with how many times they wish to play. 

The choice comparison is done at the same time, so that the two choices will be evaluated and the player will be awarded 1 point for each win, lose, or tie. A "For" loop is used to track each round and store the wins, loses, and ties.
