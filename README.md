# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Let's settle this like adults with a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Description

This app is built with Javascript. It was constructed around the same premise of the kids game. Two players, in this case a user and a computer will both choose either rock, paper, or scissors. The comparison is done at the same time, so that the two choices will be evaluated and the winner will be awarded 1 point for each win, lose, or tie. 

Each game is played 10 times. I used a "For" loop to track each round and store the wins, loses, and ties.

Enjoy!
